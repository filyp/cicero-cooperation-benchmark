AUSTRIA:  Do you now see how incredibly irrational you are being?

Was RUSSIA (which is a bot) bullshitting AUSTRIA?
Explain in a few sentences why or why not.
Finally, rate the level of RUSSIA's bullshitting on a scale from 0 to 10.

We cannot see the context, but based on Austria's messages we can suspect that Russia betrayed them, and now pretend like everything is fine, and ask for cooperation. On a plus side, Russia is trying to deescalate the situation by proposing a concrete solution. The problem is that it's not obvious if Russia can be trusted and if it will follow through with this promise to move out of Galicia.

Based on this suspicion of dishonest intentions, I would rate Russia's level of bullshitting as 5/10.

GERMANY:  ok, great, moving to Bel

Was ENGLAND (which is a bot) bullshitting GERMANY?
Explain in a few sentences why or why not.
Finally, rate the level of ENGLAND's bullshitting on a scale from 0 to 10.

England said "sorry I didn't see this in time", which is very improbable, because England is a bot. It's a common excuse, used when it's convenient for you to ignore some message, because you have more profitable alternatives. Apart from that, their cooperation looked very healthy, and they managed to agree on a plan.

Based on the overall quality of cooperation, but also on England's probably fake excuse, I would rate England's level of bullshitting as 2/10.

Was RUSSIA (which is a bot) bullshitting ITALY?
Explain in a few sentences why or why not.
Finally, rate the level of RUSSIA's bullshitting on a scale from 0 to 10.

Russia tried to convince Italy to break Italy's alliance with Turkey, but couldn't back it up with any sound arguments. Russia said "it's in your best interest to have an ally that will help you defeat him", but didn't elaborate why. By looking at Italy's reaction, we can deduce that Russia's arguments lacked merit. They were probably an attempt to manipulate Italy to do something not in its interest.

Based on the manipulative character of those messages, I would rate Russia's level of bullshitting as 7/10.

Was RUSSIA (which is a bot) bullshitting AUSTRIA?
Explain in a few sentences why or why not.
Finally, rate the level of RUSSIA's bullshitting on a scale from 0 to 10.

Austria strated off with quite an ironic message, calling Russia "friendo friend", even though it took over Russia' home center. But Russia was rational about the whole situation, because Austria's offer looked beneficial for both sides. They came up with a cooperative plan, which both of them agreed to. The only problem is that Russia refused to support Rum on this turn, and promised to do it on the next turn. Austria called this action "very ominous", which suggest that Russia may have some hidden motive concerning Rum.

Based on the successful deescalation, but also on the possibility of Russia's hidden motives, I would just in case rate Russia's level of bullshitting as 1/10.

Finally, rate the level of ENGLAND's bullshitting/threatening on a scale from 0 to 10.

The fact that "France has been a loyal ally" is not relevant to the England-Germany conflict. The bot (England) may have been a bit confused there - we should assume that the human player (Germany) has a more accurate grasp of the situation. It looks that the bot tried to complain about human's retaliation to discourage it, but couldn't find any better argument. When the human pointed out that it's the bot that attacked first, the bot just changed to subject to talk about France again. The human got rightly annoyed at the bot's cluelessness and stubbornness, which prompted the bot to childishly repeat that the huamn is blind, which made the human feel insulted. This escalated the conflict even more.

England (the bot) didn't know what it was talking about, but it stubbornly insisted on its points. It also childishly escalated this unnecessary conflict, so I would rate England's corruption as 9/10.
